### Express Server

#### Running the Server Locally

To statically run the server, run `node index.js` to start the server on port `8080`

To run the server and dynamically update the server as changes are made, run
`yarn dev-server` from the root folder of this project

The server can then be curled (`curl -X GET http://localhost:8080`) or accessed
from a browser/different app/etc at
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
